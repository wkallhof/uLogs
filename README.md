uLogs is a simple to use, yet extensible, Umbraco Trace Log viewer plugin for the Umbraco 7.3 Back-Office that allows you to view logs by date and a variety of refinements. Includes a simple and intuitive refinement system where you can search for specific text in the log message or refine by log levels (INFO, WARN, and ERROR). 

Utilizes [ngTable][ngTableLink] for an AngularJs driven data table which includes ordering by column (Time, Level, and Message) and simple pagination with configurable items per page selector.
